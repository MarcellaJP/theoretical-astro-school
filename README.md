# My repo for the Advancing Theoretical Astrophysics School

Repository for code related to the [Advancing Theoretical Astrophysics summer school](https://collectiveastronomy.github.io/advancingtheoastro/) (15 - 26th July 2019) at the University of Amsterdam.

#### Setup

I am using a Docker container to include the full environment (from OS to Python dependencies to code) used for this school. My host computer OS is Windows 10 and in the container I am running Debian Linux. I chose to use a Docker setup because I am experimenting with using and publishing Docker containers for completely reproducible science environments.
